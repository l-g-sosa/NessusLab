<h1>Vulnerability Management Lab using Nessus</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Utilized VM Workstation Pro to create a Windows 10 lab. Created a virtual machine with Windows 10 to function as machine to be scanned. Ran both credentialed and non-credentialed scans. Scans were analyzed to understand vulnerabilities and performed remediation to the ones that were considered critical and high.

The Nessus scans were performed on the virtual machine from my personal computer.

<h2>Objective</h2>
The purpose of this initiative was to enhance my knowledge of vulnerability scanning, and remediation, as well as having a better understanding of Nessus.

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus</b> 
- <b>Windows Registry Editor</b>
- <b>Windows Group Policy Editor</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

 <h2>Conclusions:</h2>
I was able to better understand the difference of credentialed and non-credentialed scanning and the scope of vulnerabilities that they are able to find. 
In using Nessus, I learned the different types of vulnerabilities and the different levels of severity. I was able to gain information about each vuln including verified ways to remediate it.
